# 📊 Analyzing Instagram Reach  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **Instagram reach** by studying user engagement patterns, post-performance metrics, and factors influencing audience interaction. The goal is to identify key insights that help improve social media strategies.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Post details** (likes, comments, shares)  
- **Engagement rate** (reach, impressions, saves)  
- **Content type** (image, video, reels, carousel)  
- **Posting time & frequency**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** for data analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation  

## 🚀 Analysis Conducted  
1. **Identifying factors affecting reach** (hashtags, captions, post type)  
2. **Time-based analysis** (best time to post for maximum engagement)  
3. **Correlation between engagement metrics** (likes, comments, shares)  
4. **Predicting reach using machine learning models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Reels and Carousels** get higher engagement than single-image posts  
- **Posting between 6 PM - 9 PM** increases reach significantly  
- **Hashtags and captions** play a crucial role in visibility  
- **User interaction (comments & shares)** contributes more to reach than just likes  

## 🔧 How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Instagram-Reach-Analysis.git
   cd Instagram-Reach-Analysis
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
4. Open `Instagram_Reach_Analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Analyzing **Instagram Stories & Reels performance**  
- Implementing **Deep Learning models** for better reach prediction  
- Developing a **real-time engagement tracker**
